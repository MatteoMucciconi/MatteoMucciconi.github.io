## Building with ChatGPT

This is the first post of my brand new website. The aim of this new website will be to host in one location numerous tools that help visualizing constructions that are common in research in the context of probability, combinatorics, integrability, etc. These could be animations related to particle systems, random trees, random polymers, Young tableaux, graphs and so on.

I will be building this website with the help of ChatGPT, which is already turning out to be extremely useful. The key to accomplish this rather ambitious goal will be consistency. For this I plan to work on this project on daily basis and as a result to post daily updates in this section.

Stay tuned for updates.
