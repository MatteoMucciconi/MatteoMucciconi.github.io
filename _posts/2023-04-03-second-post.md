## Day 2

The main goal for today was to give the website some colors. Admittedly as of now it has a strong (early) 90s vibe, but .css files can always be improved so I am not worried about that. The important thing is that I am now ready to start working on the main event, which are the applets. Tomorrow I hope to deploy the first one. To start, as usual, I will consider the simplest, nontrivial one, which in the case of the applets is the that builds a standard Young Tableau.
