Since September 2021 I am a Marie Curie Research fellow at the Mathematics Institute at University of Warwick. 

From September 2023 I will be Harrison Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.


Before coming to the UK, I have been PhD student and Assistant Professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology under the supervision of Tomohiro Sasamoto. Prior to moving to Japan I studied mathematics at “La Sapienza” University of Rome.


Integrable Probability is the theory of exactly solvable stochastic systems. It bears connections with a number of fields in mathematics and physics.  In particular I find interest in combinatorial aspects of models in the KPZ universality class.

 

In the spare time I train following the Freeletics program.
